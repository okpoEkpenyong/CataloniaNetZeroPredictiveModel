# **Catalonia Net Zero Prediction Project**  

This project aims to analyze and predict building energy performance in **Catalonia**, focusing on **cost-effective renovation strategies** to support net-zero goals. The workflow includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and strategic recommendations** based on energy savings and financial viability.

## **Getting Started**  

### **1. Clone the Repository and Set Up the Virtual Environment**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/okpoEkpenyong/CataloniaNetZeroPredictiveModel
cd 19_net_zero_buildings_prediction
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:  

```bash
python3 -m venv net_zero_env
source net_zero_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `net_zero_env\Scripts\activate`
```

---

### **2. Configure Paths and Project Files**  

Ensure that the datasets are placed in the following directory:  

```
datasets/
â”œâ”€â”€ raw/         # Contains the original data files
â””â”€â”€ processed/   # Contains cleaned and feature-engineered data
```

---

### **3. Install Dependencies**  

Install the required Python packages:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install additional modules if needed.

---

### **4. Run Jupyter Notebooks**  

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and execute the notebooks **in sequence**:  

- `01_load_process_init(ireland).ipynb`
- `02_load_process_init(catalonia).ipynb`
- `03_model_evaluate_tune_interpret.ipynb`

To start Jupyter Notebook:  

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
